# VueJS Docs Dockerized with Hexo and Nginx

## Introduction
This project provides a **dockerized version of the VueJS documentation site**, using **Hexo** as a static site generator and **NGINX** as a production web server. The setup includes a development environment where you can preview changes live and a production-like environment serving pre-built static files.

## Quick Start
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your machine. 

If you already have the setup script, you can skip the cloning (first) step.

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/pogiship/vuejs-docs-dockerized-hexo-and-nginx.git
cd vuejs-docs-dockerized-hexo-and-nginx
```

### **2. Run the Setup Script**
Make the script executable and run it:

```sh
chmod +x ./setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

**Note:** This script can run independently or after cloning repository.

This script will install the necessary dependencies, build the project, and start the Docker containers.

### **3. Access the Development Server**
Once the script completes, the **development server** will be available at:
```sh
http://localhost:4000
```
This server allows you to see live changes while working on the documentation.

### **4. Restart Containers to Apply Changes in Development Server**
If you make any modifications and need to restart the containers, run:
```sh
docker compose down
docker compose up
```
This ensures that changes take effect in the development environment.

### **5. Access the Production-Like Nginx Server**
The **NGINX web server** will be running at:
```sh
http://localhost
or
http://localhost:80
```
This serves the **pre-built static HTML files**, making it closer to a production environment.

### **6. Rebuilding Static HTML Files to Apply Changes in Web Server**

If you make any modifications and need to rebuild the static HTML files, run:
```sh
npm run build
```
This ensures that static HTML files are going to rebuild by Hexo and updated in web server.


## Detailed Explanation of the Project

### **Development Environment**
- The development server (`localhost:4000`) is powered by **Hexo**, allowing real-time previews of documentation updates.
- It is intended for making changes and testing content before deploying it to production.

### **Production-Like Environment**
- The NGINX server (`localhost:80` or `localhost`) serves **pre-built static HTML files** generated by Hexo.
- To apply updates to this environment, the static site must be rebuilt using:
```sh
npm run build
```
- This regenerates the static files in the `.public/` directory, which NGINX then serves.
- The production environment does not auto-refresh changes; they must be manually built and deployed.

## Notes
- The `setup.sh` script handles all necessary installations, so no manual setup is required.
- If you encounter permission issues with Docker, try logging out and back in or running:
```sh
newgrp docker
```
- The default ports are:
  - `4000` → Development server (Hexo live preview)
  - `80` → Production-like server (NGINX serving static files)
